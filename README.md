# Parking_Sensor
* In this project I created a parking sensors system with a graphical interface, like the ones we can see in modern cars.
* To create the graphical interface I used the Processing sketches that communicates with Arduino using the serial port.
* The code for the sensors is in C, while the code for the graphical interface is in Java.
* Components
  * Arduino board
  * 2 ultrasonic sensors
  * 2 buzzers
  * Breadboard
  * Wires
